Our study was designed to explore this issue. From 1985 to 1987 80 patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema were randomly chosen to receive either serial CPAP therapy or high-flow face mask oxygen therapy without CPAP (control) for the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of CPAP therapy. After screening for exclusion, only 55 patients were included in the first 3-hour investigation period. PaO2 in the CPAP group showed a significant increase by the end of the initial study; whereas intrapulmonary shunt and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient AaDO2 revealed simultaneously a significant reduction. Conversely, neither PaO2 nor intrapulmonary shunt (or AaDO2) in the control group demonstrated any significant beneficial changes. As for cardiovascular function, only the CPAP therapy achieved a significant reduction in rate pressure product in contrast to the control (face mask) therapy alone. In terms of therapeutic failure, 10 patients in the control group failed. However, in the CPAP group only 5 patients had failed at the end of the first 3-hour study period. Overall, the cumulative therapeutic failure rate was 28% in the CPAP group and 60% in the control group during a 6-hour observation study.

At the start of the intervention period, after 5 weeks, and after 26 weeks, both the intervention and the control groups were examined. This examination consisted of a measurement of height, weight, plasma total and HDL cholesterol, and a dietary interview. The intervention program consisted of a personalized dietary advice to the respondent, based on the report of the Netherlands Nutrition Council. The study took place between September 1987 and November 1988. Because of this intervention program, the plasma total and HDL cholesterol levels decreased. The difference in change in plasma total cholesterol between the intervention and control groups was 0.47 mmol/liter (18 mg/dl) after 5 weeks and 0.30 mmol/liter (12 mg/dl) after 26 weeks.

The use of a non-atrial sensor to overcome chronotropic incompetence and preserve normal intrinsic AV conduction in pacemaker therapy for SSS was investigated in 15 consecutive patients (mean age 66 +/- 2 years). All had intact AV conduction (antegrade conduction capacity > 100 beats.min-1 and an atrial paced to intrinsic R interval of < or = 220 ms). DDDR pacemakers capable of being programmed into atrial rate adaptive (AAIR), dual chamber rate adaptive (DDDR) and ventricular rate adaptive (VVIR) modes were used. Beginning with an acute study, arterial pressure was invasively assessed in each pacing mode during physiological stresses and low level exercise. In the ambulatory phase, the incidence of ventricular pacing and arrhythmias (Holter recording), diurnal blood pressure changes (ambulatory blood pressure recording), and symptom and quality of life level (questionnaires and interviews) were compared. Despite similar heart rate changes during acute physiological stresses, a higher blood pressure was recorded during AAIR or DDDR pacing compared with VVIR pacing. Systolic blood pressure over 24 h was lower in the VVIR mode (122 +/- 5 mmHg) than AAIR/DDDR pacing (129 +/- 6/128 +/- 6 mmHg, P < 0.05). VVIR pacing was associated with a higher frequency of atrial and ventricular ectopics, with two patients developing paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Ventricular pacing was used in a higher percentage in the DDDR compared with the VVIR mode (64 +/- 11 and 39 +/- 7%, P < 0.03). VVIR pacing was associated with more palpitations, a lower level of general well being and depression. Despite the use of a sensor to overcome chronotropic incompetence, VVIR pacing is a less satisfactory pacing mode for SSS.

Various treatments have been suggested but no controlled trial has ever been performed. Medical treatment has included anticoagulant or platelet antiaggregant therapy. Surgical correction has been proposed for selected patients who have failed medical therapy. Percutaneous balloon angioplasty and stenting have been increasingly used in some patients, although long-term results are unknown. The objective of the study was to review our recent experience with the management and outcome of extracranial CCAD. We identified 27 patients with extracranial CCAD who were evaluated, treated and/or followed by our Stroke Service from September 1995 to August 2001. Clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, management, and outcome were reviewed. There were 15 men (56%) and 12 women (44%) with mean ages of 38 and 43 years respectively. Diagnosis was made by cerebral angiography in 15 (56%) patients and by MRI/MRA only in 12 (44%) patients. Twenty-two patients had spontaneous and five had traumatic extracranial CCAD. Most common associated disorders were arterial hypertension (37%) and migraine (26%). One patient presented only with a painful post-ganglionic Horner syndrome, another patient with neck pain and post-ganglionic Horner syndrome, another patient solely with protracted unilateral headaches, three with transient ischemic attacks (TIA), and 21 with ischemic strokes. The internal carotid artery (ICA) was the most frequently involved vessel (63%), followed by the vertebral artery (30%, and multivessel involvement in two patients (7%). Eighteen patients received anticoagulant therapy and nine platelet anti-aggregants. Follow-up extended from 2 to 115 months, with a mean of 58 months. At the end of follow-up, 23 (85%) patients had either no disability or only minor sequelae (modified Rankin score: 0 to 1), and four (15%) patients had moderate limitations (modified Rankin score: 2 to 3). Two patients had a recurrent ischemic stroke, one unrelated to recurrent CCAD, and the other following percutaneous balloon angioplasty/stenting for treatment of a persistent vertebral artery pseudoaneurysm. Most CCAD involved the extracranial ICA. The clinical presentation is variable, most patients having an ischemic stroke or TIAs.

However, the infusion of even limited amounts of HES solution during the anhepatic period may result in a worsening coagulopathy. Moreover, lactate-containing HES solution may cause some degree of biochemical derangements in compromised recipients. Therefore, we compared two different types of HES solutions: a balanced salt-based high molecular weight HES solution (670/0.75; high MW group) and a saline-based low molecular weight HES solution (130/0.4; low MW group) with respect to coagulation and biochemical profiles. First, in an in vitro study (n = 48), thromboelastography was performed to determine the effects of two HES solutions on coagulation after diluting (11%) the recipient's blood sample with each HES solution. Second, in an in vivo study, 500 ml of one of the two 6% HES solution was administered to 74 recipients (n = 37, each group) for 30 min after starting the anhepatic period. The coagulation profiles, including thromboelastography, and biochemical profiles were measured before and 30 min after the end of infusion. Less impairment in the thromboelastography profiles and aPTT was observed in the high MW group. A higher calcium concentration and less reduction in platelet count were noted in the high MW group, but lactate accumulation was greater.
